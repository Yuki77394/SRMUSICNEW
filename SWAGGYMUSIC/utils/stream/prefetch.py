"""Silent background prefetch system for the next queued song.

Design goals
============
1. Only ONE next song is ever prefetched per chat (never the whole queue).
2. Prefetch runs entirely in the background — no chat messages, no
   progress bars, no notifications. Failures are silent.
3. Current song playback always takes priority over prefetch — both
   for CPU/bandwidth (limited via a global asyncio.Semaphore) and for
   correctness (prefetch tasks are cancelled on /skip, /stop, queue clear).
4. Duplicate-download protection: a per-(chat_id, video_id) asyncio.Lock
   prevents two concurrent prefetches of the same song, and the existing
   YouTube.download() function already returns the cached file if the
   video was previously downloaded — so a prefetch that fires after the
   same song was already downloaded becomes a near-instant no-op.
5. No changes to existing playback flow: change_stream() and skip_command
   still call YouTube.download() exactly as before. If the prefetch
   completed in advance, download() returns the cached file instantly,
   making the switch faster. If the prefetch failed or was cancelled,
   download() proceeds normally — graceful fallback with zero risk of
   passing None to PyTgCalls.

Trigger points
==============
- put_queue() in queue.py — fires when a new song is added to the queue.
  After the song is queued, this module checks if the just-added song is
  now the next-up (index 1) and triggers a silent prefetch for it.
- change_stream() in call.py — after the autoplay branch adds a related
  video to the queue via put_queue(forceplay=True), the same trigger fires.
- Autoplay: handled by the change_stream autoplay branch, which calls
  put_queue → which calls the prefetch trigger. No separate autoplay hook
  is needed; the existing architecture already routes through put_queue.

Cancellation points
===================
- stop_stream() and force_stop_stream() in call.py — cancels all prefetch
  tasks for that chat_id.
- skip command — when the user skips N songs, any prefetch tasks for
  those skipped songs are cancelled.
- _clear_() in call.py — cancels all prefetch tasks for that chat_id.

API surface
===========
- `schedule_prefetch(chat_id, queued_file, videoid, streamtype, video)`:
    Public entry point. Called by put_queue after a song is added.
    Decides whether to actually prefetch (only for "vid_" prefixed queue
    entries — these are the ones that hit YouTube.download()).
    Returns immediately; the actual download happens in a background task.
- `cancel_prefetch_for_chat(chat_id)`:
    Cancel all in-flight prefetch tasks for a chat. Called by stop/skip
    /clear handlers.
- `cancel_prefetch_for_song(chat_id, videoid)`:
    Cancel the prefetch for one specific song. Used by skip-N when the
    skipped songs include the prefetched next song.
- `get_prefetch_stats()`:
    Diagnostic helper — returns a dict of in-flight prefetch counts.
    Used only by /stats or debug tools, never by user-facing UI.
